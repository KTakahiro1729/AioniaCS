# AGENT Instructions

- When creating a pull request, include a Githack link so reviewers can preview the HTML after changes.
  Example:
  `https://raw.githack.com/KTakahiro1729/AioniaCS/<branch>/index.html`
  Replace `<branch>` with the branch name containing your changes.
- Use branch names that only contain ASCII characters (letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores).
